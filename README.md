# 📊 Customer Engagement Prediction

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers who are more likely to engage positively with a marketing campaign. By leveraging historical campaign data, we optimize marketing efforts, improve conversion rates, and minimize unnecessary calls.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of historical campaign data containing various features, including customer demographics, past interactions, and response outcomes. The key attributes include:
- **Customer Demographics** (age, income, etc.)
- **Campaign Interactions** (previous responses, contact frequency)
- **Behavioral Features** (purchase history, engagement levels)

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** 🛠️
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and selection
2. **Model Selection & Training** 🤖
   - Tried multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimization
3. **Evaluation Metrics** 📉
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
   - Cross-validation to ensure robustness
